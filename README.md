first of all we will init the project
then we make the components signup and home
create sign up
install json server to init the API
install axios as well 
then we play with the local storage to register user and redirect depending if they're logged in or not
Note that till this time, we wont be using session() unlike Laravel. we'd be relying just on the plain Vue js
